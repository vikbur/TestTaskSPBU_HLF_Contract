/**
 * Converter interface is a shorthand for classes who want to implement both serialization and
 * deserialization. You should always privilege Converter instead of low level Serializer and
 * Deseriliazer as they will be wrapped into a converter and all the ChainedFactory mechanism is
 * designed for converters. Here is an example of a Converter of URLs.
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 * Genson genson = new Genson.Builder().with(new Converter&lt;URL&gt;() {
 *
 * 	&#064;Override
 * 	public void serialize(URL url, ObjectWriter writer, Context ctx) {
 * 		// you don't have to worry about null objects, as the library will handle them.
 * 		writer.writeValue(obj.toExternalForm());
 *  }
 *
 * 	&#064;Override
 * 	public URL deserialize(ObjectReader reader, Context ctx) {
 * 		return new URL(reader.valueAsString());
 *  }
 *
 * }).create();
 *
 * String serializedUrl = genson.serialize(new URL(&quot;http://www.google.com&quot;));
 * URL url = genson.deserialize(serializedUrl, URL.class);
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * As you can see it is quite straightforward to create and register new Converters. Here is an
 * example dealing with more complex objects.
 *
 * @param <T> type of objects handled by this converter.
