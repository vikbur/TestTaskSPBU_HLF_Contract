/**
 * Bundles allow to package all kind of Genson customizations into a single module and register
 * them all together. Extensions are registered using Genson.Builder.
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 * Genson genson = new GensonBuilder().with(new SuperCoolExtension()).create();
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * Extension configuration is mixed with user custom configuration (no way to distinguish them),
 * however user custom config. has preference over bundle configuration. This means that you can
 * override bundle configuration with custom one.
 * <p/>
 *
 * <b>Important note, bundles must be registered after any other configuration.</b>
 *
 * This part of the API is still in beta, it could change in the future in order to make it more
 * powerful.
